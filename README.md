### Hi! I'm Brian 👋

Some folks call me `bingo` (you can too!)

- 🛠 I co-founded and am building AI agents at [ThriveAI](https://www.thriveai.work).
- 🏢 Previously I've led engineering teams at [Slack](https://www.slack.com), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com), [Google](https://www.google.com), and some shorter stints in fun things like [crypto](https://www.gemini.com).
- 🐦 You can also find me on [my blog](https://bngo.dev), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/brianngo), and on [X](https://x.com/bingoplayerone).
